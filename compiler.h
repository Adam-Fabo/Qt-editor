     * ---------------------------------------------------
     * 1.Map all IN/CONST blocks
     * 2.Process all blocks that can be processed(have all inputs defined and have > 0 inputs)
     * 3.Process all blocks with 0 inputs
     * 4.Process rest of blocks (until all blocks are in fully_processed_blocks)
     * ---------
     * Not yet implemented:
     * 5.Check for loops and process them (creates while(1) in code)
     * ----------------------------------------------------
     * 1./2.
     * -compiler starts at some input or constant
     * -it follows line going from block and into other blocks and maps these connections
     * -when al IN/CONST blocks are done it continues onto regular blocks
     * -it tries to map outputs of defined blocks again
     * -this is done in loop until no connections happen
     *
     * 3.
     * -compiler now easily processes blocks with no inputs
     * -does so by defining such a block and doing step 2.
     *
     * 4.
     * -compiler starts at some undefined block
     * -picks first undefined input and call go_upstream() on it
     * -method go_upstream() finds a block connected to input we started on
     * -(if no block is found this input is processed and we try step 2. again)
     * -if block is found we pick this block by calling process_undefined_block() and continue with go_upstream()
     * -this is repeated until no previous block is found(so current block is processed)
     * -or if compiler finds a loop (we visit the same block more than once)
     *   -> in this case the repeating block is processed
     *
     * ---------------------------------------------------
     * Notes:
     * -go_upstream() is essentialy similar to process_line() as both are trying to search for connections, but the former is used to process undefined inputs while the latter is used to map outputs to inputs
     * -step 3. is done to guarantee that IN/CONST have priority
     * -if two outputs go into 1 input, only one connection will be mapped while the other will be discarded
     * -order in which blocks and lines are placed matters considering previous point(defines order in which objects are processed)
     *
